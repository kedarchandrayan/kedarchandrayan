## Notable Projects

### Sirji: Open Source AI Software Development Agent

Sirji is a Visual Studio Code extension acting as an AI-powered software development agent. It serves as a comprehensive virtual developer, equipped with agents dedicated to planning, coding, researching, and project execution. Sirji expertly handles a wide range of tasks from initiating new projects to enhancing or debugging existing ones, including writing test cases. It intelligently interfaces with VS Code's Editor, Terminal, and Project Explorer to streamline development workflows. Users engage with Sirji through an interactive chat, submitting problems, and providing feedback. A standout feature is Sirji's ability to set up and configure local development environments, handling system and language-specific dependencies before executing code, ensuring a seamless development experience.

### Needle in a Haystack

I'm actively contributing, enhancing, and co-maintaining Needle in a Haystack (NIAH) alongwith [Greg Kamradt](https://github.com/gkamradt), the original author. NIAH is a technique for benchmarking Large Language Models (LLMs), where the model's goal is to find specific information (the "needle") within a larger context (the "haystack").

Initially introduced by Greg for GPT-4 and Claude 2.1, this evaluation has gained widespread recognition, being adopted by Google for [Gemini 1.5](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-next-generation-model-february-2024/#performance:~:text=Gemini%201.5%20Pro%20maintains,as%201%20million%20tokens) and by Anthropic for [Claude 3](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-family#:~:text=the%20'needle%20in%20a%20haystack'%20(niah)%20evaluation%20measures%20a%20model's%20ability%20to%20accurately%20recall%20information%20from%20a%20vast%20corpus%20of%20data).
