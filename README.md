# Hi there, I'm Kedar! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kedar, a Senior Director of Engineering at [True Sparrow](https://truesparrow.com/) with 15 years of product development experience. My expertise spans from individual contributions to managing teams of all sizes.

## Notable Projects

### Needle in a Haystack

I'm actively contributing, enhancing, and co-maintaining Needle in a Haystack (NIAH) alongwith [Greg Kamradt](https://github.com/gkamradt), the original author. NIAH is a technique for benchmarking Large Language Models (LLMs), where the model's goal is to find specific information (the "needle") within a larger context (the "haystack").

Initially introduced by Greg for GPT-4 and Claude 2.1, this evaluation has gained widespread recognition, being adopted by Google for [Gemini 1.5](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-next-generation-model-february-2024/#performance:~:text=Gemini%201.5%20Pro%20maintains,as%201%20million%20tokens) and by Anthropic for [Claude 3](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-family#:~:text=the%20'needle%20in%20a%20haystack'%20(niah)%20evaluation%20measures%20a%20model's%20ability%20to%20accurately%20recall%20information%20from%20a%20vast%20corpus%20of%20data).
