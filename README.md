| **DIY Automated Watering Solution**<br><br>I have a terrace garden at home that I enjoy nurturing, but watering it while awayâ€”especially during summerâ€”posed a challenge. To address this, I developed a DIY automated watering solution.<br><br>The first version utilized a Sonoff switch, solenoid valve, and a drip irrigation kit. With this setup, I can start and stop watering my plants using my mobile device.<br><br>As an electronics hobbyist, I am currently working on a second version. In this iteration, I will directly use the ESP32 microcontroller and relay instead of the Sonoff switch. Additionally, I will develop a custom mobile app to remotely control the system. | **Watch on YouTube**: [DIY Automated Watering Solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fPTQfk2qP4) |
