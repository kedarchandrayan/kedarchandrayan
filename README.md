| **Sirji: Open Source AI Software Development Agent**<br>**Role:** Owner & Co-maintainer<br><br>Sirji is a Visual Studio Code extension that acts as an AI-powered software development agent. It features specialized agents for planning, coding, researching, and executing both new and existing software projects. The extension integrates with VS Code functionalities like the Editor, Terminal, and Project Explorer. Through an interactive chat, users can provide problem statements, get assistance, and submit feedback. Crucially, Sirji also automates the setup of local development environments, handling system and language-specific dependencies, and executes code locally.|**Repo**: [Sirji](https://github.com/sirji-ai/sirji)<br><br>**VS Code Marketplace**: [Sirji](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TrueSparrow.sirji)<br><br>**PyPI**: <br> â€¢ [`sirji-agents`](https://pypi.org/project/sirji-agents/) ![Sirji Agents on PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/sirji-agents.svg) <br> â€¢ [`sirji-messages`](https://pypi.org/project/sirji-messages/) ![Sirji Messages on PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/sirji-messages.svg) <br> â€¢ [`sirji-tools`](https://pypi.org/project/sirji-tools/) ![Sirji Tools on PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/sirji-tools.svg)<br><br>**Blogs**: [Build in public series](https://truesparrow.com/blog/tag/sirji/) |
